# Two Sum

## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

Each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.  
The order of the returned indices does not matter.

## Examples

**Example 1**
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]

Explanation: `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`

**Example 2**
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]


**Example 3**
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]
